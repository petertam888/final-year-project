# final-year-project

Here is my FYP project which is related to the signal recovery using the one of the machine learning techniques - ANN. This project can be mainly seperated into two part, including :
(1)the simulation of the distorted signal (with using MATLAB)
(2)the design of the ANN - equalizer ( with using the python )
