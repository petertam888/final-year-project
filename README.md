# Final-year-project

Here is my FYP project which is related to the signal recovery using the one of the machine learning techniques - ANN. This project can be mainly seperated into two part, including :

(1)the simulation of the distorted signal (with using MATLAB)

(2)the design of the ANN - equalizer ( with using the python )

The result of the FYP is satisfied. It can achieve the 100% signal recovery within the 100km transmission distance when the Signal Noise Ratio (SNR) is 18dB or above.
